            <p>After trying the rigs and then construction I finally got a job at 19 that I really liked. It was running skidder, log loader and buncher in the hill country in Alberta near Kakwa River. It was a camp job.
                    
                I moved back to Dawson Creek to go to work for Reg Norman Trucking just before I turned 20. I ran cat and truck and we logged in the winters. He was a great guy to work for.</p>
